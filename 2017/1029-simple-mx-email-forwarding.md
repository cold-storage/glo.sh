# Simple MX Level Email Forwarding

If you own a domain and you want to be able to receive email for that domain,
but you don't need to send email from that domain,
https://forwardmx.io is nice. It will forward mail from anyone@your-domain.com 
to any email address.

This is nice if you have lots of domains and you need to receive email 
for those domains but don't want to set up a separate mail account for
each one.

You will need to be able to edit the MX records for your domain. There are 
lots of instructions all over the internet for this.

It's $9.00/yr for 5 domains. $29.00/yr for 25 domains. $99.00/yr for unlimited.
